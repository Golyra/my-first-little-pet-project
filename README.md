# my-first-little-pet-project
    I'm a university student who just started programming. I really love ARG's, specially those mixed with horror.
    My teacher started teaching us JS through p5js and he wanted us to make a game menu, not the whole game, just the menu.
    When i showed him the menu he asked where's the interactivity with the player when you pressed the 'play' button, i didn't understand, but if he wanted a little game 
  i could do a little ARG with that menu, so i just used some pics from 'the walten files' and changed the music to feel glitchy when you solved the puzzle.
    I hope to learn way more on this little journey of mine, i'll post my new projects here when i'm done with them, my current objective is to make an RPG maker, wish me
  luck!
